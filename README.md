# Car-Parking-System-
This is car parking software.  
The main reason for developed this because there were large car parks near 
the cities but there was no monitoring system for the car park.  
For that reason, I developed this parking monitoring system. 
              I created an imaginary parking spot to build this monitoring
parking system. I can park 16 cars at once in this car parking park. I designed 
this system using a very simple UI. Because I do not want to create software that anyone 
canâ€™t understands very simply. So, I designed this software that anyone can look at
this and understand this monitoring software very clearly and simply. 
              So, I can think that people (who use this monitoring system) 
can use it very quickly and do not fear computer knowledge.
